## Physiology-inspired two-stage COVID-19 detection system
This repository contains scripts used to produce reults shown in our IEEE-TASLP paper 'COVID-19 Detection via Fusion of Modulation Spectrum and Linear Prediction Speech Features'.

### Hand-crafted features
We provided two types of feature sets to capture different abnormalities of articulation system: <br />
1. **Modulation spectrum features** <br />
We also have another repository which includes a toolbox that automatically extracts different versions of modulation spectrum, it has been used previously for characterizing unnatural speech, evaluating reverberation level, and many other applications in biomedical signal analysis. You can find the toolbox here: <https://github.com/MuSAELab/modulation_filterbanks>

2. **Linear Prediction (LP) features** <br />
LP analysis has been used for separating excitation source and vocal tract, we further extracted low-level descriptors from LP residuals to characterize abnoarmal phonation pattern.
